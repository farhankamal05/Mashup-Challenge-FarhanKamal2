    <h1>My Pets</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>
      I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them           and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.

    <p>
      Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with.  I like to take her to the         park.  Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.

    <p>
      Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for           real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.

    <h3>Fish</h3>

    <p>
      Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish,         but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.
